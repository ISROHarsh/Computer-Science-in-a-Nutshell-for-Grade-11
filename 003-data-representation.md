## Data representation
_Here we will learn how the data given by us is understood and processed by a computer. Also we will learn how the data in machine code gets converted into human readable format._

* **Decimal number system** - This has ten symbols (0-9) to represent data.
* **Binary number system** - This has two symbols (0/1) to represent data.
* **Octal number system** - This has 9 symbols (0-7) to represent data.
* **Hexadecimal number system** - This has sixteen symbols (0-9 and A-F) to represent data.

## Representation of characters

* **ASCII**
  * Acronym for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
  * It was designed in the early 60's, as a standard character set for computers and electronic devices.
  * Mostly it uses 7-bit character set containing 128 characters.

  * **Examples**
     | Character  |  ASCII Code |
     |:-----------:|:------------:|
     | !       |     33        |
     | #      |     35        |
     | 1       |     49        |
     | 2       |     50        |
     | 3       |     51        |
     | A      |     65        |
     | B       |     66        |
     | C       |     67        |
     | a       |     97        |
     | b       |     98        |
     | c       |     99        |

* **ISCII**
  * Stands for "Indian Script Code for Information Interchange". ISCII is an encoding scheme that represents various languages that are written and spoken in India.
  
  * ISCII was introduced in the year 1991 by the Bureau of Indian Standards(BIS).

  *  It follows an 8-bit encoding schema and contains about 256 characters. The first 128 characters, that is, from 0-127 are same as that for ASCII. The next characters, that are from 128-255 represent the characters from the Indian scripts.

* **Unicode** 
  * Unicode provides a unique way to define every character in every spoken language of the world by assigning it a unique number. The Unicode standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium and defines more than 1,40,000 characters from more than 150 modern and historic scripts along with emoji.

  * Unicode can be defined with different character encoding like UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, etc.
